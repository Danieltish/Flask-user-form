# Flask-user-form
The code sets up a simple web application using Flask that allows users to submit their personal information through a form. It has two main routes: one for displaying the form (practice.html) and another for processing the submitted data and displaying it (submit.html). The application uses templates to render HTML dynamically based on user input.
